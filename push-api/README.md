This folder contains examples of how on integrate various sources to OpenDataSoft
using the Realtime Push API.

#### Contributing
Create a new folder and make sure it contains everything needed to run your code.
This can be a simple script, a more complex Python application with a requirements
file, a Node.JS package with a `package.json` file... In case this is something
that compiles to a binary or binary-like file (e.g. Java or C), just include the
source code with everything required to run it (software and instructions), don't
include the binary.
