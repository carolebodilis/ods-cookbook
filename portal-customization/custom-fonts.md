# Custom fonts

You may want to use a font other than *Open Sans* which we use throughout the platform.

In the following, we'll consider the open-source font *Roboto* that you can download on [google fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto).

This fonts contains 12 styles, that is 6 weights, each available in italic and regular form. For each of these styles, google fonts will provide a `.ttf` file. While most browsers support .ttf files, not all do. As a result, you should try to get your fonts files in all of the following file formats:

* `.eot` *required for Internet Explorer up to version 9Â¨
* `.svg` *required for very early version of iOS*
* `.ttf` *for Safari, android and iOS*
* `.woff`* for all modern browsers*
* `.woff2` *for the latest version of browsers*

If you are lost with all these formats, a good rule of thumb is to use the `.woff` format since it is supported by all browsers that work with the OpenDataSoft platform.

For each of these styles, you'll have to upload the corresponding files to the platform (using the *Assets* management page) and write the following CSS code.

``` css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Roboto';
  src: url('/assets/theme_font/<filename>.eot');
  src: url('/assets/theme_font/<filename>.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
       url('/assets/theme_font/<filename>.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('/assets/theme_font/<filename>.woff') format('woff'),
       url('/assets/theme_font/<filename>.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-style: <normal|italic>;
  font-weight: <100|200|300|400|500|600|700|800|900>;
}
```

If you only to have only the `.woff` format available, you'd write for each style.

``` css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Roboto';
  src: url('/assets/theme_font/<filename>.woff') format('woff');
  font-style: <normal|italic>;
  font-weight: <100|200|300|400|500|600|700|800|900>;
}
```

With this code set up in the *stylesheet* tab of the *theme* page, we can now use the font within the website.

To replace the *Open Sans* font entirely, you only have to write

``` css
html {
  font-family: 'Roboto', Helvetica, arial, sans-serif;
}
```

Note that we're not just writing `font-family: 'Roboto';`. We're also specifying a list of fonts the browser will use by default if Roboto is unavailable. The code here specifies that we should use Roboto, and if it's not available Helvetica. If even this is not available arial. The last resort is the default sans-serif font of the browser.
